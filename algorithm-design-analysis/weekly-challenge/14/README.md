# Weekly Challenge 14: Optimal Commutation
# CS 412 Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Spring 2023
***

Each Weekly Challenge (WC) invites you to critically engage with the topics covered up to that week. WCs may take on a variety of formats and be available and attempted through diverse platforms as the semester progresses. They may be attempted individually or in teams as indicated.

# Purpose

This WC invites you to find the optimal solution using either a greedy approach or a dynamic one. The question of deciding which approach is efficient is left for you.

# Background

To attempt and submit the task you will need
- an ability to solve a problem using a greedy approach
- comfort with GitHub and LaTeX
- ability to code in Python
- familiarity with Graphs 

# Task and Submission

The task for this WC is explained in the accompanying prompt which is to be compiled in LaTeX. You will enter your solution in the indicated space in the same file. Make sure to include in your repository any supporting files needed for successful compilation. The files in your repository at the time of the submission deadline will be considered your submission.

# Grading

The score earned by your submission will be assigned to the team assuming that the buddies contributed equally. To confirm, teams will be occasionally called in for a viva on their submission. If any of the members is unable to explain the submission or does not appear for the scheduled viva, the _team_ will lose marks not only for that WC but for previous WCs in which they were awarded marks based on trust. You are encouraged to report non-contributing buddies through the [appropriate form](https://hulms.instructure.com/courses/2616/quizzes/7187).

# Deadline and discussion

_Deadline_: 2359h on Sun, 16 Apr
