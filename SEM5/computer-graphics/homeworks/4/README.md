# Homework 4: Raytracer
# CS 440 Computer Graphics, Fall 2022
-----

# Purpose

This homework sets the foundation of an extendable ray tracing engine using principles of Object Oriented design. It implements some of the ray tracing topics we have covered, namely:

- tracing a ray through a scene
- sampling a scene
- perspective and parallel projection
- ray-primitive intersections

# Background

For this homework, you must know

- how to read and write object oriented code in C++
- how to compile a c++ project spanning multiple files in multiple directories
- vector arithmetic

# The Problem Set

The problems as well as your tasks are defined in `hw4.tex` which is to be compiled using a LaTeX compiler.

# Previous Feedback

Feedback from the previous set of students who attempted this assignment is summarized in the accompanying file, `feedback.md`. 

# Submission

There are 2 parts to the submission.

## 4.1 Problem Set

Submit _all_ code files in the `raytracer` folder and its relevant subfolders. `World.cpp` should include an implementation of `World::build` corresponding to your desired scene. Compiling and running `raytracer.cpp` in the `raytracer` folder should generate the corresponding image as `scene.ppm`. You may include other `World::build` implementations in the `build` folder. 

This is a __team submission__, i.e. a single submission per team. Your team has a single repository to which each of you will have access. Your team submission will be assigned a __Submission Score__ based on the correctness of the contained solutions.

_Deadline_: 2359h on Wednesday, 7 December

# 4.2 Feedback

You will provide feedback on your team and on the assignment by filling the feedback form which will be made available as _HW 3.2_ on the course page. This is due at the same time as the problem solutions.

This is an __individual submission__, i.e. each of you has to fill the form. Doing so contributes to your __Team Factor__ which is 1 by default and is penalized in case of non-submission of the form, dishonest feedback, or unequal contribution to the submission as reported by your buddies and/or the commit history on GitHub.

_Deadline_: 2359h on Wednesday, 7 December

# Grading

Your submission will be peer-graded in a double-blind manner as per the criteria specified in the accompanying file, _hw4-review.xlsx_. The score thus earned will be your _Submission Score_.

Your individual score in this homework is the product of your Submission Score, and Team Factor.

# Discussion

There is a lot to handle and there are bound to be confusions and queries. Please utilize the following avenues.

- discuss with your buddies
- post in the discussion thread linked in the Assignment module on the course page on Canvas.
- talk to course staff.
