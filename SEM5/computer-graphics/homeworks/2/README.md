# The Problem Set

Based on earlier feedback on specific questions, some have been dropped from his homework, many have been reworded for clarity (hopefully), an example is included in Problem 2. Further clarity on the problems will be provided in the recitation if needed.

# Submission

There are 3 parts to this assignment. Lack of submission of any part will result in a loss of marks.

## 2.1 Solving the Problem Set

Each problem specifies the names of the files to be submitted for it. Please make sure your submitted files have the indicated names. Any files in your GitHub repository with these names at the time of the deadline will be considered as your submission. As your submission will be graded by your peers, please do not include identifying information in it.

This is a __team submission__, i.e. a single submission per team. Your team has a single repository to which each of you will have access. Your team submission will be assigned a __Submission Score__ based on the correctness of the contained solutions.

Deadline: 2359h on Fri, 30 Sep

## 2.2 Feedback

You will provide feedback on your team and on the assignment by filling the feedback form which will be made available as _HW 2.2_ on the course page. This is due at the same time as the problem solutions.

This is an __individual submission__, i.e. each of you has to fill the form. Doing so contributes to your __Team Factor__ which is 1 by default and is penalized in case of non-submission of the form, dishonest feedback, or unequal contribution to the submission as reported by your buddies and/or the commit history on GitHub.

Deadline: 2359h on Fri, 30 Sep

## 1.3 Peer Review

Two submissions will be shared with you for review which you will evaluate according to the accompanying rubric. You will submit a filled copy of the rubric for each submission against _HW 2.3_ which will be made available on the course page.

This is an __individual submission__ on LMS and contributes to your individual __Review Factor__ which is 1 by default and penalized for non-submission.

Deadline: 2359h on Mon, 3 Oct

# Grading

Your submission will be peer-graded in a double-blind manner as per the criteria specified in the accompanying file, _hw2-review.xlsx_. The score thus earned will be your _Submission Score_.

Your individual score in this homework is the product of your Submission Score, Team Factor, and Review Factor.

# Discussion
