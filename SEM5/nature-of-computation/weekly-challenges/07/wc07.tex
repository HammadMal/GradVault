	\titledquestion{Stay Put}

	The Turing machine we encountered in class has the transition function,
	\[
		\delta:Q\times\Gamma\to\; Q\times\Gamma\times\{L,R\}.
	\]

	Consider a variant of a Turing machine whose transition function is,
	\[
		\delta:Q\times\Gamma\to\; Q\times\Gamma\times\{L,R, S\},
	\]
	where $S$ indicates that the head stays at its current location.

	Prove that this variant is no more powerful than the original, i.e. the set of languages accepted by both types of machines is the same.

	\begin{solution}

		Lets say we have two Turing Machines, \(M_1=(Q,\Sigma,\Gamma,\delta_1,q_0,q_\text{accept},q_\text{reject})\) and \(M_2=(
		Q,\Sigma,\Gamma,\delta_2,q_0,q_\text{accept},q_\text{reject})\), where transition functions are defined as,
		\[
			\delta_1:Q\times\Gamma\to\; Q\times\Gamma\times\{L,R\}
		\]
		and
		\[
			\delta_2:Q\times\Gamma\to\; Q\times\Gamma\times\{L,R,S\}.
		\]
		
		We have to show that \(L(M_1)=L(M_2)\). First we will prove that \(L(M_1)\subseteq L(M_2)\). This is trivial because all the languages that are accepted by \(M_2\) which does not involve head staying at its current location, these languages are accepted by the \(M_1\).
		
		Now, we will prove that \(L(M_2)\subseteq L(M_1)\). For this we would show that \(S\) can be replaced with some combination of \(L\) and \(R\). For every triplet \((q,a,S)\) as out of transition function we would introduce two new triplets \((q,a,L)\) and \((q,a,R)\) and then language accpeted by \(M_2\) is the language accepted by \(M_1\). This is because the head will stay at its current location iff it moves left or right. So, we have replaced \(S\) with some combinations of \(L\) and \(R\). This will means that \(L(M_2)\subseteq L(M_1)\) and hence \(L(M_1)=L(M_2)\). \hfill\(\blacksquare\)
