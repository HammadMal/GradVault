# Homework 3: Turing Machines and Decidability
# CS 212 Nature of Computation, Fall 2022

---

# Purpose

This homework includes problems on Turing machines, equivalence of computational models, decidability, and recognizability.

# Background

For this assignment, you should
- read and write formal notation
- recall the definition of a Turing Machine in various forms: high-level, implementation-level, and formal
- design and describe a Turing machine
- prove equivalence of a variant with a Turing machine
- recall the definition of a decidable language
- recall the definition of a recognizable language
- recall the definition of a language
- recall the Chomsky hierarchy of languages
- argue about the decidability and recognizability of a given languages

# The Problem Set

The problems are in `hw3.tex` which is to be compiled using a LaTeX compiler.

# Submission

There are 2 parts to this assignment.

## 3.1 Solving the Problem Set

Insert your solutions in `solution` environments in `hw3.tex`. The file named `hw3.tex` in your GitHub repository at the time of the deadline will be considered your team's submission. Make sure that any included files, e.g. image files, are also present in the repository.

This is a team submission on GitHub and contributes to your _Submission Score_.

Deadline: 2359h on Fri, 11 Nov

## 3.2 Feedback

You will provide feedback on your buddy and on the assignment through a from which will be available on LMS with further instructions. The form will be due at the same time as the problem set.

This is an individual submission on LMS and contributes to your individual _Team Factor_ which is 1 by default and penalized for non-submission, inaccurate feedback, or non-participation in the team as assessed through peer feedback or GitHub contribution.

Deadline: 2359h on Fri, 11 Nov

# Grading

Your submission will be graded for correctness of your solutions. __Files that do no compile cannot be graded__. 

Your individual score in this homework is the product of your Submission Score and Team Factor.

# Discussion

Please use the following avenues:

- discuss with your buddy,
- the discussion forum on LMS,
- discuss with your peers,
- consult with course staff.
